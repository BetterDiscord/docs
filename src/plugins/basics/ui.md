## BdApi Helpers

There are some utility functions from `BdApi` that help you build and display certain UI elements. Using them instead of building your own saves you code and helps ensure a consistent UI/UX for the end user across plugins. While they may work for a large range of cases, for advanced UIs (and ones not handled in `BdApi`) you will need to build your own.
