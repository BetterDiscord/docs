# Guidelines

These are guidelines that all themes are expected to abide by. Any themes that violates these <u>will not</u> be added to the BetterDiscord website or marked as official or approved in any fashion. Existing themes that push updates that violate these guidelines will have their updates denied.

## General Guidelines

 - Addons must be in public GitHub repositories.
 - Addons must not negatively affect users.
   - e.g., ban risk, disabling security features, accessing private information
 - Addons must not discriminate whom can use it.
 - Addons must not collect user data without opt-in consent.


## Usability
- Do not degrade the user experience by removing core functionality.
- Do not target a specific user or group of users in a negative way (do not attempt to "ban" people).
- Do not encourage users to further violate Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms), or promote content from outside of the official repository.
- Try to maintain support for Discord's accessability features.
- Maintain performance on modern hardware. This can be done by limiting the use of intensive animations, filters and effects.

## Code
- Your theme's codebase must be made and written primarily by you. You may not submit an automatically-generated theme, a customized version of someone else's theme, or a codebase written by someone other than you.
- Only import code from trusted services. (Github, Gitlab, Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts, etc...)
- Do not abuse remote resources to gather user information, use untrusted content, or circumvent security permissions.
- You may reverse-engineer or use other people's code, provided you have proper permission and your theme's core design does not rely on third-party code. This does not apply if it is your first submission.

## Design
- Themes should not be a basic recolor or background change change (some exceptions apply). Themes should significantly alter the look and feel of Discord.
- Themes should have full coverage of most common pages, popouts, modals and controls. Keep in mind that changing discord's variables does not provide full coverage of the app.
*Although filesize should not affect the submission process, 1000 lines is a good goal to aim for in your theme.*
- NSFW images or assets are not allowed in official themes.

## First Theme Policy
These guidelines apply only if this is your **first** submission.
- First themes must be original. You may not borrow large portions other people's codebase (some exceptions may apply).
- First themes cannot be an "addon" or "mini-theme".
