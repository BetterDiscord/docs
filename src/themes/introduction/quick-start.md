# Quick Start

## Quick Start

If you already know the basics, or just prefer to learn by trying it yourself and poking around, try this basic plugin template.

```css multi=true
<!-- js -->
/**
 * @name ExampleTheme
 * @author YourName
 * @description Describe the aesthetic. Maybe a support server link.
 * @version 0.0.1
 */

<!-- css -->
:root {
  --my-size: 13px;
  --my-color: #000000;
}
```

Save this as `YourTheme.plugin.js` in your themes folder (found below) and enable it!

## Theme Folder

### Windows
`%appdata%\BetterDiscord\themes`
