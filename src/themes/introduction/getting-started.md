# Getting Started

## Quick Start

If you already know the basics, or just prefer to learn by trying it yourself and poking around, try this basic plugin template.

```css
/**
 * @name ExamplePlugin
 * @author YourName
 * @description Describe the basic functions. Maybe a support server link.
 * @version 0.0.1
 */

:root {
  --my-size: 13px;
  --my-color: #000000;
}
```
