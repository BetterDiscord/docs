# What is BetterDiscord?

BetterDiscord or BD is a client modification for the desktop Discord application. This mean that if BetterDiscord is installed, it runs _within_ Discord when it runs. It is not a separate application or process on your computer.

## Core Features

### Twitch Emotes

BetterDiscord fully integrates Twitch emotes sourced from BTTV, Twitch, and FFZ.

### Live Editor

BetterDiscord allows you to modify your Discord application and see the changes apply in real time.

### Transparency

BetterDiscord can make the Discord application partially see-through leading to very cool designs and desktop environments.

### Public Servers

BetterDiscord adds a public server directory sourced from [DiscordServers.com](https://discordservers.com/). This is different from the built-in discovery feature of Discord because DiscordServer is a community run listing and does not have the same requirements as discovery.

### Temporary Vanilla

BetterDiscord allows you to return to vanilla Discord functionality without having to remove BetterDiscord. This is useful for many contexts. This is done using the `--vanilla` command line flag. For Mac and Linux, just run Discord from the command line with that command line flag and you'll get the vanilla experience. For Windows, find your Discord shortcut, right click it and select `Properties`. Find the `Target` section, and at the end of that add ` --vanilla` including that space and you'll be able to run vanilla Discord through that shortcut.

## Addons

BetterDiscord is able to be extended, allowing user content to be loaded into the system.

### Plugins

Plugins can increase the functionality and user experience of the app through JavaScript. Write your own or download plugins made by the community.

### Themes

Themes allow you to completely customize your client with CSS. You can either make your own theme, or download the wide variety of themes from our community.
