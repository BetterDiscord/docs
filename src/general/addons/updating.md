# Updating

## Your Addon

Updating your addon on the website is pretty simple, just update your addon on GitHub. The webhook will automatically send the update to the website where it will once again go through the approval process. This is done to prevent malicious updates from making it through, whether by a compromised developer account, or by a disgruntled developer.

## Your README

Your README for your plugin updates separately from your plugin and can be updated at any time by updating it in your GitHub repository. Unlike addons, this has no review system so you don't have to wait for someone to approve of it to see it update on the website.
