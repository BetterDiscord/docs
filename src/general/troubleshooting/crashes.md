<details>
<summary>⚠️ BetterDiscord seems to have crashed your client.</summary>

This is a very generic error that could mean any number of things. It also doesn't necessarily mean BetterDiscord was at fault. It could have been a plugin or even Discord itself. It's just difficult for BetterDiscord to tell who is the cause so it catches them all.

Fixing issues like this involves the following:
 - Switching to Stable from Canary or PTB
 - Manually updating library plugins
 - Removing unofficial plugins
 - Rename the plugin folder

<summary>"Well, this is awkward" or "You died, looks like you got slaughtered by an Error Level 9000"</summary>

This type of error is usually caused by something being out of date. Ensure your copy of BetterDiscord and your plugins and keys are up to date.
