Now you might think that themes are generally mutually exclusive so we shouldn't worry about variable collision. But users also often use CSS snippets or littel pieces of other themes that include variables that can collide. It's generally recommended to prefix your CSS variables with something unique to your theme. For example the ",(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://betterdiscord.app/theme/Nox"},"Nox")," theme prefixes their variables with ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"nox-")," so they have variables like ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"--nox-accent"),".
