# Theme Guidelines
These are the requirements and rules that themes in our official repository must follow. These exist to ensure a safe and user-friendly environment, as well as maintain variety and originality in our themes. Themes found in violation of these guidelines will not be allowed into the official repository.

## Definitions
- **Theme:** A stylesheet written to alter the look and feel of Discord.
- **Mini-theme:** A small styesheet which changes the look and feel of Discord in one area, or in a minor way.
- **Assets:** Resources that your addon utilizes, including but not limited to images, fonts, code and videos.
- **Official Repository:** The listings of themes and plugins which are publicly downloadable from [http://betterdiscord.net/](http://betterdiscord.net/).
- **User:** Any individual who uses or has used your addon.
- **Remote Assets:** Assets which are stored outside your local theme file.
- **Security Permissions:** Any features put in place by the client to protect users, including but not limited to the Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Usability
- Do not degrade the user experience by removing core functionality.
- Maintain usability performance-wise on modern hardware. This can be done by limiting the use of performance-intensive animations, filters and effects.
- Do not target a specific user or group of users in a negative way (do not attempt to "ban" people).
- Try to maintain support for Discord's accessability features.
- Do not encourage users to further violate Discord's [Terms of Service](Terms of Service), or promote content from outside of the official repository.

## Code
- Your theme's codebase theme must be made and written by you. This means you cannot submit an automatically-generated theme or have the majority of your codebase written by someone else.
- Only import code from trusted services. (Github, Gitlab, Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts, etc...)
- Do not abuse remote resources to gather user information, use untrusted content, or circumvent security permissions.
- You may reverse-engineer or use other people's code, provided you have proper permission and your theme's core design does not rely on code that isn't yours. This does not apply if this is your first theme for submission.

## Design
- Themes should not be a basic recolor or background change (some exceptions apply). Themes should significantly alter the look and feel of Discord.
- Themes should have full coverage of most common pages, popouts, modals and controls. Keep in mind that changing discord's variables does not provide full coverage of the app.
*Although filesize should not affect the submission process, 1000 lines is a good goal to aim for in your theme.*
- NSFW images and assets are not allowed in official themes.

## First Theme Policy
These guidelines apply only if this is your **first** submission.
- First themes must be original. You may not borrow large portions other people's codebase (some exceptions may apply).
- First themes cannot be an "addon" or "mini-theme".
