# Theme Guidelines
These are the requirements and rules that themes in the official repository must follow. These exist to ensure a safe and user-friendly experience, as well as maintain originality and variety. Themes found in violation of these guidelines will not be allowed into the official repository.

## Usability
- Usability should be prioritized over look and feel.
- Do not degrade the user experience by removing core functionality or hiding important areas.
- Your theme should be optimized to run well on normal hardware.
- Do not target a specific user or group of users in a negative way (do not attempt to "ban" people).
- Although it is not required, you should try to ensure that Discord's accessibility options are compatible with your theme.

## Code
- It should go without saying that your theme must be made and written by you. This means you cannot submit an automatically-generated theme or have the majority of your codebase written by someone else.
- Only import code from trusted services (Github, Gitlab, Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts, etc...)
- Do not abuse remote resources to gather user information, use untrusted content, or circumvent security permissions.
- You may reverse-engineer or use other peoples code, provided you have proper permission and your theme's core design does not rely on code that isn't yours. This does not apply if this is your first theme for submission.

## Design
- Themes should not be a basic recolor or background change (some exceptions apply). Themes should significantly alter the look and feel of Discord.
- Themes should employ a mostly consistent design.
- Themes should have full coverage of most common panels, modals, controls and popouts. Keep in mind that only changing discord's variables does not provide full coverage of the app.
*File size does not play a role submission, however around 1000 lines of code generally indicates fair coverage of the app.*
- NSFW images and assets are not allowed official themes.

## First Theme Policy
These guidelines apply only if this is your **first** submission.
- Your first theme must be original. You may not borrow large portions other people's codebase (some exceptions may apply).
- Your first theme cannot be an "addon" or "mini-theme".
