# Overview

::: tip

This section goes over general information that is useful to both plugin and theme developers alike. For more details on either one visit their respective pages.

:::

Currently, BetterDiscord only supports two main types of addons: [Plugins](../plugins/) and [Themes](../themes/). They serve as the main way to personalize and control your own client. All addons are required to provide certain meta information, which you can learn more about on the [addon system](./addons.md) page.

## Plugins

Plugins are a type of addon that focus on functionality by adding something new to the Discord client. This could be as simple as a button that says hello, or basic end-to-end encryption. Plugins can also modify existing functionality in the client like altering existing buttons to perform different actions, or even remove functionality entirely. All of this is done using JavaScript with minimal requirements to allow for personal preference and style in programming. To read more about making them, check out the [plugin documentation](../plugins/) after finishing this section.

## Themes

Themes are exactly as they sound, a way to completely alter the look and feel of the client. Some themes might just add a background image to the client, while others try to emulate the look and feel of other programs, or even other operating systems. They do this by using pure css like a webpage as opposed to using preset names that limit the creativity of developers. To read more about making them, check out the [theme documentation](../themes/) after finishing this section.
