# BetterDiscord Documentation

:::caution

Documentation is still under construction. Some links may either work improperly or not be added.

:::

## Breakdown

This site is split into three separate sections:
- General documentation mainly aimed at end-users but has some useful information for developers as well.
- Plugins which, as the name would suggest, is for plugin developers.
- Lastly Themes which is for theme developers.

The last two include not only documentation for reference, but tutorials and information on what is and is not acceptable in plugins and themes.
