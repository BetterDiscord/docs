# Welcome

:::info

This documentation and the accompanying guides assume you already know CSS and are familiar with the Developer Tools, finding DIscord's classes and styling them. If you're not, check out the resources section below!

:::

These docs consist of this introduction which gives you an idea of what to expect, an overview on plugins and the development environment, a few guides, and an API reference.

The [Introduction](../category/introduction) section gives a lot of background information on themes requirements, the development environment, and the tools at your disposal.

[Quick Start](./introduction/quick-start.mdx) will walk you through the basics of making themes including a template for the the theme file, as well as the location themes are/should be saved to.

Lastly, your theme (or any other kind of addon for that matter) must follow these [Guidelines](./introduction/guidelines).
