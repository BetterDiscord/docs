# Overview

Themes are exactly as they sound, a way to completely alter the look and feel of the client. Some themes might just add a background image to the client, while others try to emulate the look and feel of other programs, or even other operating systems. They do this by using pure css like a webpage as opposed to using preset names that limit the creativity of developers.
