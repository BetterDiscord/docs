# Developer Tools

These are tools that help with both general web development, and working with the React UI library. 

### Chromium DevTools

If you have past web development experience you are probably already familiar with the Chrome/Chromium DevTools. If not, it might be a good idea to give [its documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) a once-over.

Working in this Discord (and BetterDiscord) environment, we have access to these DevTools. Discord has this disabled by default, but it is possible to reenable this functionality in the BetterDiscord settings. Go to the BetterDiscord Settings page and find the Developer Settings. Then check the option for DevTools.

Once this is enabled, you can press `ctrl`+`shift`+`i` (or for a Mac `cmd`+`opt`+`i`) to open the DevTools just as you would in Chrome.
