# Quick Start

## Hello World

If you already know the basics, or just prefer to learn by trying it yourself and poking around, try this basic theme template.

```css:line-numbers [YourTheme.theme.css]
/**
 * @name YourTheme
 * @author YourName
 * @description Describe the aesthetic. Maybe a support server link.
 * @version 0.0.1
 */

:root {
  --my-size: 13px;
  --my-color: #000000;
}
```

Save this as `YourTheme.theme.css` in your themes folder (found below) and enable it!
