## Manual Installation

For those that can't get the automatic installers to work, those that want more control over their installation, and for developers.

### Prerequisites

- Git - https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- npm - (comes with node on most systems)
- pnpm - `npm install -g pnpm`

### Steps

#### 1. Clone the BetterDiscord repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BetterDiscord/BetterDiscord.git
```
If this fails due to region lock or something similar, you can download a zipped copy directly from https://github.com/BetterDiscord/BetterDiscord/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

#### 2. Enter the directory
```bash
cd BetterDiscord
```

#### 3. Install dependencies
First install `pnpm` if you have not done so already
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then install BetterDiscord's dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

#### 4. Build BetterDiscord

This will create an `injector.js`, `preload.js`, and `renderer.js` in the `dist/` folder.
```bash
pnpm build
```

#### 5. Install to Discord
