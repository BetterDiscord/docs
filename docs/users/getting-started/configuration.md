# Configuration

BetterDiscord has a number of settings and options for you to adjust your experience to your preference. This page will focus on the most common options. For a complete list, just visit the settings page inside BetterDiscord itself!

## General

These are settings that don't really fit elsewhere.

### Emote System

This option allows you to toggle the Twitch emote system on or off. If you don't use it, it's good to leave this off as it saves your computer som RAM and CPU power.

### Public Servers

This option shows or hides the Public Servers button. If you don't use it, feel free to turn it off.

## Custom CSS

### Main

This option allows you to completely disable the custom css system. If you don't use it, turning this off saves you a bit of RAM and CPU power.

## Developer

### DevTools

This option allows you to open the chromium devtools with the usualy `ctrl`+`shift`+`i` combination. If you're not a developer, best to leave this off.
