## Crashes

Crashing when using BetterDiscord can be frustrating. Here are some helpful tips to solve your issues.

::: details ⚠️ BetterDiscord seems to have crashed your client.

This is a very generic error that could mean any number of things. It also doesn't necessarily mean BetterDiscord was at fault. It could have been a plugin or even Discord itself. It's just difficult for BetterDiscord to tell who is the cause so it catches them all.

Fixing issues like this involves the following:
 - Switching to Stable from Canary or PTB
 - Manually updating library plugins
 - Removing unofficial plugins
 - Rename the plugin folder

 :::


::: details "Well, this is awkward" or "You died, looks like you got slaughtered by an Error Level 9000"

This type of error is usually caused by plugins or BetterDiscord being out of date. Ensure your copy of BetterDiscord and your plugins and keys are up to date.

## Installation

This section goes over common issues and pitfalls when trying to install BetterDiscord.

### General Issues


::: details Cannot select stable, or BetterDiscord not installed after installing

This is usually an issue with Discord moving around its installation location on Windows. Sometimes the installer is unable to differentiate what to do. To fix it, select `Browse` in the installer, then enter `%localappdata%/discord/app-1.0.9006/resources` in the address bar at the top. If this has the same issue repeat this but using `%programdata%/%username%/Discord/app-1.0.9006/resources`
