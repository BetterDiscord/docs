description: How to not BetterDiscord.

# Multiboot

BetterDiscord allows you to return to vanilla Discord functionality without having to remove BetterDiscord. This is useful for many contexts. This is done using the `--vanilla` command line flag. For Mac and Linux, just run Discord from the command line with that command line flag and you'll get the vanilla experience. For Windows, find your Discord shortcut, right click it and select `Properties`. Find the `Target` section, and at the end of that add ` --vanilla` including that space and you'll be able to run vanilla Discord through that shortcut.
