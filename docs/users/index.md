## Core Features

### Twitch Emotes

BetterDiscord fully integrates Twitch emotes sourced from BTTV, Twitch, and FFZ.

### Live Editor

BetterDiscord allows you to modify your Discord application and see the changes apply in real-time.

### Transparency

BetterDiscord can make the Discord application partially see-through leading to very cool designs and desktop environments.

### Public Servers

BetterDiscord adds a public server directory sourced from [DiscordServers.com](https://discordservers.com/). This is different from the built-in discovery feature of Discord because DiscordServer is a community-run listing and does not have the same requirements as discovery.

### Dual Boot

BetterDiscord allows you to have multiple shortcuts to Discord that allow you to quickly boot with or without BetterDiscord. No need to fiddle with installing and uninstalling.

### Plugins

Plugins can increase the functionality and user experience of the app through JavaScript. Write your own or download plugins made by the community.

### Themes

Themes allow you to completely customize your client with CSS. You can either make your own theme or download the wide variety of themes from our community.
