3. Your code is reviewed by the review team.
4. A decision is made on your submission.

### Denial

1. You'll get a notification that your submission was denied along with a reason message.
2. Check your GitHub for any issues opened by the review team.
2. Make any necessary changes and resubmit.

### Approval

1. You'll get a notification that your submission was accepted.
2. Your submission will be immediately available on the website.
2. If you didn't already have a developer role, you'll be given one in the Discord server.


## The Expectations

There are some general guidelines all addons are expected to follow:

 - Addons must be in public GitHub repositories.
 - Addons must not negatively affect users.
   - e.g., ban risk, disabling security features, accessing private information
 - Addons must not discriminate whom can use it.
 - Addons must not collect user data without opt-in consent.

There are also guidelines specific to plugins and themes. You will find those in their specific documentation pages.
