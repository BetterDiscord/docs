# Overview

If you're looking for a tutorial or a guide on how to actually make plugins, you should take a look at our [plugin guide](/plugins/) instead! Otherwise, if you're just looking for a quick reference point for the API, take a look at [BdApi](./bdapi.md) for a good starting point.

## Structure

`BdApi` is a global found on the `window` object and is readily accessible to all plugin at all times. It is generally structured into namespaces that group similar utility functions together into logical units.

The list on the left has all the namespaces currently available as well as more information on `BdApi`.
